# Welcome to the bitfloat repository!

This place is dedicated to the bitfield approach. It currently hosts the R-package, the community standards and soon also the manuscript, which is currently still a work in progress.

Everybody is welcome to contribute, (ab)use the software, extend it or upload additional standards.
